            <summary>Why is there a new Cadance beta app?</summary>
            <p>To enable the integrated watchOS app and improve visibility in your app list, Cadance now uses a new app ID and TestFlight beta with a brighter icon. Because Apple treats this as a completely new app, it appears as a separate install.</p>
            <p>You can safely delete the older, darker Cadance icon when you are ready. The only downside is that any music you imported into the previous beta will need to be imported again into the new one. This reset is a limitation of how app identifiers and TestFlight work, not something we can change.</p>
