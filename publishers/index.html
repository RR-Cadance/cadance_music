        <h2>The Cadance Effect: Transforming Music into Professional Tools</h2>
        <p>Dance teachers need capabilities that only music ownership can provide. When educators discover these professional features, your music becomes essential equipment—not just entertainment.</p>
        
        <div class="features-grid">
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Precision Tempo Control</h3>
            <p>Real-time adjustment from 60-200% without pitch distortion. Teachers adapt any track for different skill levels, from beginner practice to performance speed.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Bulletproof Reliability</h3>
            <p>Complete offline access ensures classes never depend on WiFi. Your music works perfectly whether in a basement studio or mountain retreat.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Seamless Looping</h3>
            <p>Perfect repetition for skill building. Teachers create smooth practice sessions where students master complex movements without interruption.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Professional Environment</h3>
            <p>Clean, distraction-free audio maintains focus. No ads, no buffering, no unexpected interruptions during critical instruction moments.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p class="highlight"><strong>Result:</strong> Teachers invest in music as professional equipment, building libraries of 200+ albums because ownership unlocks capabilities streaming simply cannot provide.</p>

        <h2>Music That Works: Every Genre Benefits</h2>
        <p>Professional tempo control and offline access transform any music into teaching tools. Here's how different styles gain enhanced value:</p>

        <div class="features-grid">
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Classical & Jazz</h3>
            <p>Ballet teachers slow orchestral pieces for barre work, then speed them up for center combinations. Jazz recordings become technique tools when teachers control the tempo for different skill levels.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Pop & Electronic</h3>
            <p>Radio hits and electronic beats work perfectly for contemporary dance when teachers can loop specific sections for choreography practice and adjust energy levels.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>World & Cultural</h3>
            <p>Latin rhythms, world music, and cultural traditions become essential when teachers can preserve authentic rhythms while adjusting tempo for learning complex movements.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Specialty Styles</h3>
            <p>Musical theatre, ballroom, country, hip-hop—every genre gains professional utility when educators can control tempo, create perfect loops, and ensure reliable offline access.</p>
